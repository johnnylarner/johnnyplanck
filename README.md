# Johnny's planck
This repository documents how the my planck is setup.

I opted to keep functional keys on the edge of the keyboard. These, plus a couple of extra punctuation symbols, are passed through every layer. 

Layers are controlled by toggles but can be overridden by the `TO(0)` key which will send you back to layer 0.

## Prerequisites
I use [via](usevia.app) to modify my planck. To enable VIA support follow steps 1 and 2 from [this guide](https://maxzsol.com/step-by-step-guide-to-setting-up-qmk-for-the-planck-on-macos/).

## Layer 0
Alphabetic Layer in the dvorak setup.
